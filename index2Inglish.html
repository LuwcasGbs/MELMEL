        <h1>Challenges</h1>
            </section>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) affects some of the current jobs, but it also opens up opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs, according to experts gathered this Tuesday (9) at the Chamber of Deputies.
            They participated in the debate “Professions at Risk: Artificial Intelligence and Employability”. Deputy Helio Lopes (PL-RJ), rapporteur of an ongoing study at the Center for Strategic Studies and Debates (Cedes), coordinated the meeting.
            “The net result of the impacts of artificial intelligence is uncertain, it will depend on companies and workers”, summarized Marcello Luiz de Souza Junior, one of the managers in São Paulo of the National Industrial Training Service (Senai).
            The research indicates that 37% of jobs in Brazil are exposed to generative artificial intelligence, which means that this portion may undergo significant changes in the way they work.</p>

        <h1>Relationship between Technology and First Job</h1>
            </section>
        <p>Technology has a significant impact on first jobs, expanding opportunities and requiring new skills.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Easy access: Digital platforms and social networks help young people find jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Emerging sectors: Areas such as IT, digital marketing and the sharing economy offer accessible jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Digital skills: Basic tools and technological knowledge are essential even in traditional jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Online training: Free courses and institutions such as SENAI prepare young people for the technology market.</p></li>
        <li><p>Challenges and opportunities: While technology increases competition, it also promotes innovation, automation and remote work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Technology not only expands opportunities for first jobs, but also defines many of the skills needed to enter the market. Young people who quickly adapt to tools and innovations have a better chance of success, especially in a scenario where digital transformation is constant. Technological training, therefore, is an indispensable differentiator.</p>

        <h1>Humanization of technology</h1>
            </section>
            <p>The humanization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of technologies that mimic human behaviors, such as communication, decision-making, and emotional interaction. The goal is to make interactions with AI more natural, intuitive, and effective for users, impacting employment by creating new demands for human skills, such as creativity and empathy, and by improving human-machine interaction at work.
                New opportunities: Professions in areas such as AI training, experience design, and hybrid customer service are on the rise.
                Support for workers: Humanized AIs automate repetitive tasks, facilitate communication, and offer personalized training.</p>
                <p> The humanization of technology is an approach that seeks to ensure that technology is at the service of people, not the other way around, such as including differences in management and care processes. Such changes are built not by an isolated person or group, but in a collective and shared way. Inclusion to stimulate the production of new ways of caring and new ways of organizing work. With telemedicine, for example, the team of specialist doctors who would otherwise only be responsible for evaluating exams can be used to provide care. The team is thus reinforced by specialists who can provide support and reduce the number of daily consultations made by each professional.
                
                Technological innovations, such as virtual assistants and IoT (Internet of Things) devices, are transforming people's daily lives, providing greater convenience and efficiency. Virtual assistants, such as Alexa and Google Assistant, simplify tasks through intuitive voice commands.
